# Memory Game

Welcome to the Memory Game! This is a classic tile-matching game built with Next.js and React.

## How to Play

- The game board consists of a grid of face-down tiles, each hiding an emoji.
- Click on a tile to flip it over and reveal the emoji.
- Flip a second tile to try to find a matching pair.
- If the two tiles match, they will remain face up.
- If they do not match, they will flip back over after a short delay.
- Continue flipping tiles and matching pairs until all tiles are matched.
- Try to complete the game in as few flips as possible!

You can choose different grid sizes for a more challenging or easier game. Click the "Reset" button at any time to start a new game.

Enjoy testing your memory and have fun!
